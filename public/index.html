                <p>Pink Floyd is a legendary rock band formed in London in 1965. Originally led by Syd Barrett, they became famous for their psychedelic sound and elaborate live shows. After Barrett left, Roger Waters and David Gilmour shaped the band's direction. Albums like "The Dark Side of the Moon" and "The Wall" have left a lasting impact on rock music, blending deep themes with experimental soundscapes, making them one of the most influential bands of all time.</p>
